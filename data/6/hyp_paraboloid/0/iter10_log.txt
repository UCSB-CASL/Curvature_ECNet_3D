>> Began generating hyperbolic paraboloid data set for offline evaluation with a = 33.6, b = 11.2, max |hk| = 0.35, and h = 0.015625 (level 6)
   Collected and saved 39648 samples (incl. the six permutations) with the following stats:
   - Number of saddle points   = 6607 (or 13214 samples)
   - Tracked mean |hk*| in the range of [3.66842e-06, 0.345458]
   - Tracked max hk error      = 0.172071
   - Tracked max h^2kg error   = 0.173276
   - Tracked max |phi error|/h = 0.0618933

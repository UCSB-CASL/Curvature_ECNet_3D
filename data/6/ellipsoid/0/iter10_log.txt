>> Began generating ellipsoid data set for offline evaluation with hk_a = 0.345182 (a = 1.65), hk_b = 0.148637 (b = 0.75), hk_c = 0.0033517 (c = 0.2), and h = 0.015625 (level 6)
   Collected and saved 372786 samples (incl. the six permutations) with the following stats:
   - Number of saddle points   = 0
   - Tracked mean |hk*| in the range of [0.00335175, 0.344328]
   - Tracked max hk error      = 0.0748136
   - Tracked max h^2kg error   = 0.0148203
   - Tracked max |phi error|/h = 0.0453169

Using 6 data-packet permutations.

>> Began generating paraboloid data set for offline evaluation with a = 25.6, b = 12.8, c = 0.5, max |hk| = 0.6, and h = 0.015625 (level 6)
   Collected and saved 14502 samples (incl. the six permutations) with the following stats:
   - Number of saddle points   = 0
   - Tracked mean |hk*| in the range of [0.0275431, 0.563775]
   - Tracked max hk error      = 0.132645
   - Tracked max h^2kg error   = 0.0976582
   - Tracked max |phi error|/h = 0.0746133

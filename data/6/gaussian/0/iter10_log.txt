For two networks with -7e-6 as non-saddle sample lowerbound.
Using 6 data-packet permutations.

>> Began generating Gaussian data set for offline evaluation with a = 1., su^2 = 0.130208, sv^2 = 0.0144676, max |hk| = 0.6, and h = 0.015625 (level 6)
   Collected and saved 108000 samples (incl. the six permutations) with the following stats:
   - Number of saddle points   = 14107
   - Tracked mean |hk*| in the range of [1.89171e-07, 0.587298]
   - Tracked max hk error      = 0.188631
   - Tracked max h^2kg error   = 0.0481826
   - Tracked max |phi error|/h = 0.081521
